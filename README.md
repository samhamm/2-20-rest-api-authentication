*Code Fellows JavaScript Development Accelerator Assignment: Create a REST API using authentication and HTTPS*

####Note: This code is excessively commented-out, to the goal of understanding the massive amount of information that was thrown at us this week.

This app will allow the user to securely store a database of her/his pets. The following kinds of data are accepted by this app:

* Name (stored as a string)
* Species/Breed (stored as a string)
* Age (stored as a number)
* Coloring (stored as a string)
* Personality (stored as a string)
* Lives With Me (true/false)

For instance, one of my felines:
* Name: BuddyCat
* Species/Breed: Tiger
* Age: 12
* Coloring: Orange with white highlights
* Personality: Meowy and demanding of attention
* Lives With Me: true

And, one of my canines:
* Name: Demi
* Species/Breed: Border Collie
* Age: 9
* Coloring: Black and white
* Personality: Everything is her favorite
* Lives With Me: false
